Stock Trading Application

This application uses a MySQL database containing stock trading information for 100+ companies.
Users are prompted to enter a company 'ticker' and optional date range to retrieve an optimal
investment strategy. If no range is given, an investment strategy is executed across all dates
available for a specifc ticker.

This class will identify and adjust for stock splits, and will execute an investment strategy
designed to maximize profits through buying/selling shares in response to a moving market
average price.

Currently, an established connection with the johnson330 database is required for proper
execution. An example interaction of the program is provided in the "sample_out.txt" file.
